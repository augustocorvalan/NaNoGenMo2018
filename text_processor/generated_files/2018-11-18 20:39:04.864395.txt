Mornings

Woke up alone. I looked at my nails, how dirty they were.

Mornings

Woke up without appetite. I got naked and washed in the tub.

Everything That Happened:

I woke up with a fever. I looked at my hands, which were covered in cuts. I fell asleep.

I woke up and I could see nothing in the dark. I didn't feel good so I took an aspirin. I went into his room at night. He was asleep. It was impossible to see in the dark. I sensed his figure and heard his breath. I put the machine on the nightstand. I unspooled the mask and placed it over his face. The rhythm of his breath changed but he didn't move. I turned the machine on. The breath became rapid and shallow. Then it slowed. Then it couldn't be heard. It took seven minutes.

I woke up and could't open my eyes. I cut my nails.
